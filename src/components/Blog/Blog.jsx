                     In a one-way data binding system, data flows in a single direction, from parent components to child components, and child components cannot directly modify the data in their parent components. </span></p>

                                <td>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-based data model. It stores data in collections of JSON-like documents, where each document can have a different structure. This flexibility is suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data.</td>
                                <td>MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses tables to store data. Data in MySQL is structured, and tables have a predefined schema with columns and data types.</td>

                                <td>MongoDB uses a query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL) to interact with the database. MQL is designed for querying JSON-like documents and supports a wide range of queries, including complex and nested queries.</td>
                                <td>MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language), which is a powerful and standardized language for querying and managing relational data. SQL supports joins, transactions, and complex queries.</td>

                                <td>MySQL is a reliable choice for applications that require strict data consistency and transactions, such as e-commerce systems, financial applications, and traditional relational database use cases.</td>
